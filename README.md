HiPC_Flavor_OpenFoamScripts
=========================

Storage for scripts I use to run OpenFoam simulations for a paper submission I need to complete by 5/30/2012.

This is a fork of my other project OpenFoamSimulationScripts. File settings such as ControlDict and SetFieldsDict, as well as the chassisList need to be changed between these experiments, thus the fork.
