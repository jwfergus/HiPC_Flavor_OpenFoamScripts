OpenFoamSimulationScripts
=========================

Storage for scripts I use to run OpenFoam simulations

The simulations we perform (impact.asu.edu) are meant to verify models of thermal flow within datacenters. While constructing and validating models of physical phenomena is important in it's own right, our major goal is to improve the energy efficiency of scheduling algorithms used in data centers.
